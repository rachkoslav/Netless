# Netless
  -- Simple SMS Application

## Prerequisites
Python 2.7 version installed.

---
## Setup
To install the required libraries run the following code from the Netless directory:
`sudo make init`. This will install libs like twilio, Flask and requests, which are crucial for the application to runs and funcions correctly.

---
## Running the application
There are two ways of doing this:
1. Executing `python netless/netless.py &` from the project directory
2. Executing `bash make run` from the project directory.

The latter one seems to not recording logs which I find strange.

---
## Internet Usage
Application requires open `5000` port to be able to communicate with the twilio api.

---
## Future
<b>NOTE: This is a overnight developed project!<b>
